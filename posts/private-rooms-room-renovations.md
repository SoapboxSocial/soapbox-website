Today we added some major improvements to private rooms. Only admins can invite new users and private rooms are not visible on the home feed, so you donâ€™t have to worry about being seen online.

Another thing the Soapbox team fixed - the order of rooms on the home screen. When you refresh the home feed, rooms will no longer change their order and the rooms that were created first will display at the top in chronological fashion. In addition to room renovations, Groups can now be edited- the creator of the group can edit the description or change the image!
