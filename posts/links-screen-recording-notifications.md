Each day our team strives to make Soapbox more user friendly and fluid. By popular request, we added a sharing button so users can hop into a room directly from a link! We knew how important this feature was to seamlessly invite others to a room outside of the app.

Additionally, we wanted to make sure Soapbox users weren’t being recorded by anyone in the room. No more screen recording! If a user tries to record their screen while inside a room, everyone in the room will be warned. Sorry... you just had to be there.
