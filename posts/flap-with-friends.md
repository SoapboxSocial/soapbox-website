Last month, we launched [Soapbox Minis](/blog/introducing-minis) to make rooms more than just conversation. The first-ever Minis were Polls, Would You Rather, and Chosen At Random. Recently, we dropped [Trivia](/blog/trivia-improvements) with over 4,000 questions in over 24 categories, including Film, Video Games, General Knowledge, Music, Books, and much more.

Fast forward to today, the Soapbox Team is excited to announce the new Birds Mini! Users can compete by flying the bird as far as possible without hitting the pipe.

We hope the Birds Mini throws a fun twist into the Minis experience. We would love to know what you think!
