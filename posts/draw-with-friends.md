We let you [Flap with Friends](/blog/flap-with-friends), now we’re gonna let you Draw With Friends!

We are excited to release the new Draw With Friends Mini! Select a word to draw for friends, then watch them try to guess and make hilarious drawings for you. No Van Gogh skills are required. All you have to do is wiggle your finger to create a masterpiece for everyone in the room to guess.
