We let you [Flap with Friends](/blog/flap-with-friends), and now we’re going to let you Draw With Friends!

We are excited to release the new Draw With Friends Mini! Select a word to draw, then have your friends try and guess what you drew. No Van Gogh skills are needed. All you have to do is sketch with your finger to create a masterpiece!
