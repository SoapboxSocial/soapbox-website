A few months ago we brought Stories to the home page of Soapbox. If you have something interesting to say, you can record it as a story allowing all of your followers to listen to it. Stories automatically delete after twenty four hours and can be however long you wish. All you have to do is press the story symbol on the top left of the home page, hold down the microphone button, record whatever is on your mind, and hit post!
