We’re bringing stories to the feed of Soapbox. If you have something interesting to say, you can record it as a voice-only story allowing all of your followers to listen to it. Stories automatically delete after 24 hours and can be however long you wish. All you have to do is tap on your profile photo on the top left of the feed, hold down the microphone button, record whatever is on your mind, and hit post!
