We've been working hard to accommodate feedback from our biggest fans. By making the [home feed cozier](/blog/home-sweet-home) and releasing [even more Minis](/blog/draw-with-friends), we wouldn't be where we are today without you all.

We are excited to release enhanced notification preferences. Users will now have the option to customize their notifications with room join, creation frequency, and new follower messages.

Notifications enrich the Soapbox experience, which is why we've been working hard to get them just right.
