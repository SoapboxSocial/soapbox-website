When a user creates a room, public or private, they become the admin by default. With great power comes great responsibility! The admin has a magical set of powers such as the ability to mute, remove other admins, and ban users from their room. All users can report an incident, block other users, and report a group. Soapbox is a platform built for users, our team truly cares about the quality and experience our users have within rooms and with one another.
