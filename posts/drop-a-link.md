Sometimes it can be hard to stay interested in a conversation when you haven’t seen what the speaker is referencing, so we added link sharing to keep everyone on the same page. Hit the bottom right icon to drop a link that’s copied to your clipboard, and show exactly what it is you’re talking about for everyone in the room to see!

Admins of the room are able to pin links, otherwise they will eventually disappear.

Link sharing is one of the best beloved features of the app. Users have been watching youtube videos together, sharing tweets, and displaying their favorite songs for everyone to see.
