The Soapbox team became inspired by user’s [stories](/blog/announcing-stories) of their favorite tracks, so we decided to give stories a fresh new look and feel.

Today, we’re thrilled to release an update that makes stories more lively and visually pleasing. After you update the app and post a story, you will notice some exciting new changes! The background of the story preview is the dominant color of a user’s profile image, the top of the story preview displays separate progress bars, and you can skip back and forth by pressing on the left or right side of the story preview. We hope the Soapbox community enjoys the improved playback and versatility of stories. As always, [we love to hear what you think](mailto:support@soapbox.social)!
