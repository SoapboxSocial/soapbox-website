title: Hop on Our Soapbox
---

Soapbox has been on the AppStore a little shy of 3 months now, that may not seem like a long time. However, we’ve come a long way since we started working on this app and launched it on TestFlight, and today we are excited to launch **Soapbox Version 2**.

Audio has been exploding into prevalence in the social media scene as a great new medium in interacting and consuming content, we’ve seen the rise of real-time and asynchronous interactions (via Stories). We believe in this new medium being a positive and least superficial method of social interaction.

At Soapbox we strive to enable genuine and friendly communication, instead of likes and visual popularity, we focus on engaging conversations, reactions, and sharing content as conversation pieces.

Since our initial launch on the App Store and our debut on Product Hunt we’ve added a bunch of features and improvements and we don’t plan on slowing down anytime soon.

Our users are at the core of what we do at Soapbox, and we’re always talking and engaging with them talking, listening, and asking questions and feedback to improve our platform for you all.

## Stories

One of the many features we’ve launched is Stories, an asynchronous method for you to leave a message for your followers to see what you’re up to. If you only have a moment to check the app and can’t join in or start a conversation, leave a quick story, your followers can react to it and often start conversations about your story later on.
