Soapbox has been on the App Store almost 3 months now. That may not seem like a long time, but we’ve come a long way since we started working on this app and launched it on TestFlight. Today we are excited to launch **Soapbox Version 2**!

Audio has been exploding in the social media scene as a great new medium of interacting and consuming content. We’ve seen the rise of real-time and asynchronous interactions (via Stories). We believe this medium will be a positive, more meaningful method of social interaction.

At Soapbox we strive to enable genuine and friendly communication. Instead of likes and visual popularity, we focus on engaging conversations, reactions, and sharing content as conversation pieces.

Since our initial [launch on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/soapbox-talk-with-anyone/id1529283270) and [our debut on Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/soapbox-talk-with-anyone), we’ve added a bunch of features and improvements. We don’t plan on slowing down anytime soon. Our users are at the core of what we do at Soapbox, and we’re always engaging with them to improve our platform for everyone.

## So What’s New in 2.0?

The main focus of our v2 release is the corner-stone of our product: voice. We’ve decided to rework everything from the ground-up, making your rooms more reliable and better quality.

Additionally we’ve implemented a ton of user feedback. Rooms can now be moved to private or public after already being created and users will be asked whether they want to be an admin of the room rather than just becoming one when added by someone else.

## What's Next?

Beyond improving the current features in our app, we have a lot of plans to ensure that not only does Soapbox mimic the real world experience of meeting friends, but also enhances it.

Some of our upcoming features include micro-apps, games and polls. Users will be able to open these inside rooms and whoever is in the room will be asked if they’d like to join in the session and interact with them.

We also plan on making an open source SDK for developers to be able to build their own games that interact with a user’s Soapbox profile.

In the near term, we are focusing on ensuring our current users are engaged and that our new users get the warm welcome they deserve when signing up.

We’re incredibly thankful for all of the feedback and love our users have been giving us these past few months, and we’re hoping you’ll come along for the ride!
