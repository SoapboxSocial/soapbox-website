After we released [Draw with Friends](/blog/draw-with-friends), we needed to make it easier to invite them!

We’ve shortened the links to profiles and rooms with soap.link/_@your-username_ e.g [soap.link/@mikec](https://soap.link/@mikec) and soap.link/_room-unique-id_, and made it even easier to share the room you’re in to other apps.

Now when you share a link to the room you’re in you’ll see a new and improved preview.

We hope these new improvements expand the reach of rooms and make it easier to compete with friends outside of Soapbox.
